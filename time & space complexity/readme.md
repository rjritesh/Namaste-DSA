# Time and Space Complexity----

## What is an algorithm?
> An algorithm is a set of instructions used for solving problems or completing a task.

## What is time complexity?
> Time complexity is a metric that is used to determine the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of it's speed when input size grows.
> ### Time complexity is not equal to time taken by a program.


## Note- 
>Time complexity is always considered for worst case beacuse for best case TC will be   almost similar for every algorithm.

## Time complexity priorities
>> O(log<sub>n</sub>) > O(n) > O(<sub>n</sub>logn) > O(n<sup>2</sup>) > O(n<sup>3</sup>) > O(2<sup>n</sup>) > O(n!)
