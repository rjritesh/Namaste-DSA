## What is Recursion?
- Function calls itself to solve smaller version of same problem. 

## Parts of Recursion--
-  Base Case- It is the condition when satisfied, function stops itself to run further
-  Recursive Case - It is part, where function calls itself.

## Import Point -
- Never Miss base case, doing so leads to stack overflow.
- Simplyify the input ( In recursive case )
- Never make deep recursion i.e large inputs
- Keeps Time complexity in mind
